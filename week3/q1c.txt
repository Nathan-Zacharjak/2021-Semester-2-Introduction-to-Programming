Input           Expected Result
[-10:0.5:10]    B: In the shape of a cubic, a
                reverse 's' shape that
                intersects the x and y axis at
                (0,0)

                C: An exponential shape, starts
                off flat, reaches 1 on the y-axis
                then shoots upwards quickly

[-100:0.5:100]  B and C will appear on top of each
                other as the graph is now much more 
                'zoomed out' on the x-axis. 
                On the left of y=0 B and C will appear
                as near-straight lines

[-10:5:10]      There will only be 5 points on the
                x-axis, so the graphs of B and C will
                appear more like polygon shapes.
                The graph will appear more like a
                scatter plot, but with similar shape
                to using the range [-10:0.5:10]
